## Introduction:

This project is part of my personal data analytics learning journey.
The goal was to explore how data-driven decision-making can transform healthcare operations by turning raw data into actionable insights.Using a public Kaggle dataset, I performed data cleaning in Excel and analysis in SQL Server and then developed a set of interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize trends across medical, operational, and financial domains.

## Key Metrics:

Medical Insight Dashboard (Last 6 Years)
1. what is the Average medication effectiveness.
2. The most common conditions, with high medication usage and long patient stays.
3. The top 10 most worked doctors.
4. Top Insurance providers.
5. Prescription trends.
   
Operations & Admissions Overview (2024)
1. Current occupancy.
2. Discharges and Doctors.
3. Average length of stay.
4. Top the list of most-used medications.

Finance & Revenue Performance (2024)
1. $97M+ annual revenue generated from 3,384 patients
2. Elective and Emergency admissions contribute the most revenue
3. Revenue shows strong seasonal patterns, useful for planning

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated:

- Data Gathering
- Data exploration in SQL server and cleaning in Excel.
- Writing complex SQL queries to extract insights
- Data modeling and relationship building in Power BI.
- Dashboard optimization
- Quick measures
- Linking operational performance to financial outcomes

### Analysis:
This project combined three interconnected dashboards: Medical Insights, Operations & Admissions, and Finance & Revenue — to give a complete view of healthcare system performance.

#### Medical Insights Dashboard (Last 6 Years)
- Medication Effectiveness: The average effectiveness of all prescribed medications is just 33%, which suggests that treatment strategies may need to be reviewed or updated for better outcomes.
- Common Conditions: Arthritis and Diabetes emerged as the most frequent diagnoses. They also have the longest patient stays and highest medication usage, indicating they drive much of the clinical workload and cost burden.
- Doctor Performance: Analysis of the top 10 most worked doctors showed a clear link between doctor assignment and patient length of stay — meaning staff allocation could directly influence operational efficiency.
- Insurance Coverage Patterns: Providers like Cigna, Medicare, and UnitedHealthcare dominate patient coverage. This suggests these insurers have significant influence over patient access and care continuity.
- Prescription Trends: A decline in Lipitor usage was observed, while traditional drugs like Aspirin and Paracetamol remain steady, showing evolving prescription patterns that may affect procurement planning.

#### Operations & Admissions Dashboard (2024)
- System Capacity: The system is operating at 100% bed utilization, which highlights full capacity and the urgent need for effective scheduling and resource planning
- Operational Scale: There were 3,827 discharges handled by 3,369 doctors in the year, showing a large workforce and high patient turnover.
- Efficiency Benchmarks: The average length of stay is 15.76 days. This figure is critical for measuring operational efficiency and identifying where process improvements could shorten stays.
- Medication Usage: Aspirin and Penicillin are the most-used medications, which could guide future inventory and cost management strategies.
- Admission Types: Admissions are almost evenly split across Elective, Emergency, and Urgent, indicating a balanced patient flow that requires flexible resource allocation
- Age-Linked Costs: The 61–80 age group drives the highest billing, highlighting the cost pressures of caring for older populations.
- Room Utilization: Specific rooms (20, 19, 18) are consistently busiest, revealing potential bottlenecks in patient flow and opportunities for rebalancing room allocations.

#### Finance & Revenue Dashboard (2024)
- Revenue Scale: The system managed 3,384 patients and generated $97M+ in total revenue in 2024, demonstrating the scale and financial importance of this healthcare network.
- Revenue Drivers: Elective and Emergency admissions contributed the most revenue, and billing strongly correlates with longer patient stays. This shows that improving efficiency could also reduce revenue volatility.
- Hospital Performance: Facilities like Smith I.C. and William L.C. are the highest revenue contributors, showing how heavily the system relies on certain hospitals for financial stability.
- High-Cost Conditions: Arthritis and Asthma each generated about $18M, making them priority areas for cost control initiatives.
- Seasonal Trends: The data showed clear revenue seasonality, suggesting a strong case for using this trend to plan budgets, staffing, and inventory around predictable demand cycles.

This analysis revealed how clinical, operational, and financial factors are deeply interconnected. It showed that optimizing just one area like doctor allocation or patient flow, could have ripple effects on costs, efficiency, and patient outcomes.

## Conclusion: 
This project successfully combined Excel cleaning, SQL-based data exploration with Power BI data visualization to analyze hospital bed utilization. The process moved from collecting and cleaning raw data to deriving insights with SQL queries and finally developing an interactive dashboard to communicate findings effectively.

The analysis revealed consistently high bed occupancy across most facilities, with general hospitals bearing the heaviest load. Regional disparities and temporal spikes in usage highlight how bed demand fluctuates over time and location. The persistent full-capacity operation of some hospitals suggests systemic pressure and limited surge capability.

## Recommendations:
Based on these findings, the following steps are recommended to improve hospital bed management:

- Increase Surge Capacity: Introduce temporary or flexible bed spaces in hospitals with sustained full utilization to reduce strain during demand peaks.
- Balance Resource Allocation: Redistribute patient loads or resources between regions and hospital types to reduce pressure on overburdened facilities.
- Implement Real-Time Monitoring: Use real-time dashboards like the one built in this project to help decision-makers respond quickly to capacity bottlenecks and emerging trends.
- Conduct Seasonal Forecasting: Apply predictive models to historical data to forecast high-demand periods and plan resources in advance.
- Continuous Data Integration: Establish automated data pipelines from hospital systems to SQL Server and Power BI to ensure up-to-date occupancy insights.

These actions can help improve healthcare system resilience and ensure that patient care is not compromised during periods of high demand.
